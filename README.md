# CS5001_Final_Project
Cycling is a crucial part of everyday life in Vancouver. As a cycling enthusiast myself, I often explore bike paths around my home, appreciating the convenient amenities provided along these routes. I decided to use public data to develop programs for exploring bikeways and locating public washrooms to enhance the cycling experience.

Environment setup
1.	Install Required Libraries
Open your command line interface (CLI) and install the necessary libraries using pip:
pip install requests folium geopy
2.	Download the Project files and unzip it into the local folder
3.	I created the blank __init__.py for each folder, keep this in the folder so that it allows the test file recognize the right path
4.	I also import sys in the test file to make sure if any path can not be recognized or accessed.
5.	Navigate to the project directory in your CLI, and run the script:
python data_dashboard.py
6.	This will initiate the program, and you can start interact with it in the terminal.
